Welcome to the **Blender-files** repository! This repository contains the original `.blend` files for my various Blender projects.

## What's Inside
Here, you'll find the complete project files used to create the renders and animations showcased in my other repository. These `.blend` files offer a behind-the-scenes look into the materials, lighting setups, camera angles, and animation sequences used in my work.

## Explore and Modify
Feel free to download, explore, or modify these files to better understand the techniques and workflows I use in Blender. You can use them as learning resources or adapt them for your own projects.

## Render Engines
The projects within these `.blend` files are designed using:
- **Eevee**: Fast real-time rendering with impressive results.
  
<p align=center>OR</p>

- **Cycles**: For more detailed and realistic path-tracing renders.
